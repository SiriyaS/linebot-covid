### linebot COVID-19 Tracker (only infection in Thailand)
## Setting Line Official Account
create your line messaging API in https://developers.line.me/

â€» set **Auto-reply messages** to **Disable**

â€» also **Enabled webhook**

â€» copy your **Channel secret** and **Channel access token**

Ready to implement your code!

## Implement Line API
â€» clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/SiriyaS/linebot-covid.git
```
cd to the project

â€» set up virtual environment (if you don't have, install by `pip install virtualenv` first)
```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```
â€» activate the virtual environment
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
you can deactivate the virtual environment by type `deactivate` in terminal
â€» install all dependencies in project
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
â€» change **Channel secret** and **Channel access token** to yours

It's time to implement yor line API logic!

â€» the logic for bot to answer the chat is in `function handle_message` 

â€» the **text messeage** from the chat room is `event.message.text` variable

â€» this line is how your linebot gonna answer (`reply_message` is the message your bot gonna answer)
```
line_bot_api.reply_message(
        event.reply_token,
        reply_message)
```
â€» when you finish implementing the code **push** your work to your own **GitHub**

Next we gonna deploy our work to Heroku

â€» for **Deployment Method** select **GitHub**

â€» select **repository** and **branch** you want to connect with

â€» for **Automatic Deploys** click **Enable Automatic Deploys** (if you want to deploy your work automatically whenever you push to GitHub)
